            After working as a teacher for seven years, I've dived headfirst
            into the world of coding, and I love it! I'm 33-years of age, and
            currently immersed in frontend studies at Noroff School of
            Technology and Digital Media. Besides being a true crime junkie, I
            have a keen interest in people, delectable food and wine, the great
            outdoors, and of course, coding and design. and design.

            From crafting handbags out of old cloth scraps to developing
            engaging teaching plans, I've always been driven by the joy of
            creation and witnessing tangible results. Working with frontend, I
            get to combine my love for creativity, visual communication, and
            design with creating web solutions with user experience in mind.
          </p>
          <p class="light_text">
            My journey started from scratch as I dived into HTML, CSS, and
            Vanilla JavaScript with no prior coding experience. The projects you
            see on this site represent my first year of work. I'm eager to
            continue this journey, developing and soaking in every bit of
            experience along the way.
